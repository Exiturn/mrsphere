# Mr Sphere

This is a little practice application that covers the basics of three.js along with some little gsap timeline animations. The start of learning three.js, with more projects involving the framework coming soon...

### What I Learned

I learned the basic fundamentals of rendering a 3D object inside of a browser using javascript and the three.js library. Coming from a games development degree, It helped solidify the already existing knowledge of 3D matricies and viewports.

The small usage of gsap also gave me some practice with their animation pipeline, as I am more used to using other, simpler animation libraries such as AOS.

This little project has definitely made me want to delve deeper into Three.js and skill it further.
